# Project 8 - 7 Swifty Words

Days 36-38 of 100 Days Of Swift

https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100

## Topics

Day 36: Building a UIKit user interface programmatically.

Day 37: Adding targets to a button, separating and joining strings, hiding views, and property observers: didSet.

## Challenges

Day 38:

1. Use the techniques you learned in project 2 to draw a thin gray line around the buttons view, to make it stand out from the rest of the UI.
2. If the user enters an incorrect guess, show an alert telling them they are wrong. You’ll need to extend the submitTapped() method so that if firstIndex(of:) failed to find the guess you show the alert.
3. Try making the game also deduct points if the player makes an incorrect guess. Think about how you can move to the next level – we can’t use a simple division remainder on the player’s score any more, because they might have lost some points.
